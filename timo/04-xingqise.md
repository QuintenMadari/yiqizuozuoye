### Radicals

1. 贝 (Bèi) and 见 (Jiàn)

>贝 refers to 'shell' and 'money'
>见 refers to 'to see'

2. 忘 (Wàng) uses the radical 心 (Xīn) since it concerns the 'heart'. 忘 means 'to forget'

### 生词

`一会儿` (Yīhuǐ'er) means 'see you soon'. Use instead of 再见 (Zàijiàn) which means 'goodbye'. 会 means 'to (re)turn'

`一带一路` (Yīdài yīlù) One Belt One Road is the new program of 中国 to connect with the west (西部). 带 also refers to 'to restrain oneself' or 'discipline oneself'.

`自己` (Zìjǐ) meaning 'oneself' or 'own'. In the past the character (汉字) 自 would mean 'nose' as you would point to your nose when pointing to oneself. Now the character for nose `鼻` (bí) is more complex.

`姓名` (Xìngmíng) meaning 'name' is official, since it has `姓` (surname) and `名` (name). 姓 has the radical 女 (Nǚ) since many surnames are given from females (not sure about this.. factcheck). Furthermore, intellectual people have 名字 (Míngzì). For friends, 字 is enough.

### 来和去 (Lái hé qù)

来 to 'come' and 去 to 'go'. Dependent on where you are and where you are going (or where someone else is going) you use 来或 (huò, 'or') 去.
