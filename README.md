# 作业!

我们开始吧！这是坤腾和地膜的作业

## 更新中

### Updating the site

The site is based on simple text files with some formatting called Markdown. It's really beginner friendly too, so there's no need to be frightened!

The file/folder structure in [一起做作业](https://github.com/QuintenMadari/yiqizuozuoye) is the Table of Contents you see on the left. Headings within the markdown files will create a third layer in the table of contents.

Currently whenever files are changed or added, they will become visible here within 15 minutes :D
