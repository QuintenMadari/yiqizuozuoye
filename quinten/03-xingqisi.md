### Verb+的（+adjective）

The verb and 的 are inseparable. They should be next to one another
- 我说普通话说得还可以 is the full way of describing the way you speak (V-O-V-的)
- 我普通话说得还可以 is the more natural (lazy) way. Kind of like O-V-的, but let's not remember it like this）
- 说的还可以 is ok when answering, the big topic and secondary topic are inferred

### Two types of 了

Verb 了 and sentence 了. 了 is not past tense, there is no such thing as a tense in 中文.

Instead it's 'vague' because it's a difficult concept to define and/or because there could be more to it. Too difficult to define 'just like that' in a way that everyone listening gets it immediately. But then, tenses are a strange difficult thing for Chinese people studying western languages.

了 functions as a marker of 'change'. It's used when an action wasn't done or finished before, but
 - 'now' it is, 
 - Or 'then' it will be,
 - Or 'back then' when it had finished (and something then happens after)

So it points to a specific point in time relative to the context established in the sentence (and or somehwere else I don't know).

You can wash dirty laundry. At this point the laundry is still dirty. If 你洗了, you have finished washing.

Important to note, when continuing the sentence, you can't just add 衣服。, that would be 'leaving the listener hanging like yesss?'. You have to either specify an amount like 一件衣服 or continue the sentence with more actions or objects to make it 'feel' good. 

The whole sentence can be finalized as well. The example of writing a letter, finishing writing but not having finished the letter:
- 我写一封信， I'm writing a letter
- 我写了一封信了， I'm finished writing, and done with the letter
- 我信了一封信， I'm done writing now, not saying the letter is finished, it's probably not, but I'm not writing anymore, Imma do something else.
- 我写一封信了， This is wrong usage of 了, as far as I understood. Not sure, but maybe you can't have finished the letter if you're writing. I'm writing a finished letter. I guess that would sound strange. Or very mysterious. But probably just wrong in Chinese.


### Culture things

- Within putonghua there are a lot of dialects already. Let alone when including the myriad of ethnic groups.
